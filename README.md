## Introduction
I used the datasets provided by the WPRDC. I chose the following metrics to measure the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh:
- Baseball Field amount
- Number of playround equipment in neighborhood
- Art & Culture place

The best neighborhood should be the ones that attract the most young college students. In order for this to be successful, it must be surrounded by excellent recreational facilities such as art galleries gyms restaurants and other similar facilities. Due to the fact that I am a huge lover of baseball games, which happens to be one of the most popular sports in the state, one of the most appealing neighborhoods to live in is one that includes a large number of baseball fields. So that I can have fun, meet new people, and enjoy watching games with my family in my leisure time. Because there are numerous baseball fields in the area, the neighborhood is extremely lively and energetic. Another statistic to consider is whether or not there is a lot of playground equipment in the neighborhood, as this is useful for families with children. Young children require a plethora of recreational opportunities. An abundance of playground equipment indicates a healthy population as well as an active and prosperous economy in the area. In addition, the arts and culture atmosphere is quite essential since residents in this area can spend their spare time attending art exhibitions and concerts. Furthermore, the cultural ambiance of an area is extremely significant.

## The Metric
I defined the best neighborhood as the neighborhood with a most energetic place that will be fully explained in the following three analysis, which is the neighborhood have **highest Baseball field amount**, ** Most the number of playround equipment** and **Most art places**

## my first Conclusion

Based on my research analysis on the Baseball Field Listing dataset, Squirrel Hill South and Brighton Heights are the best neighborhoods since they have the same top amount of baseball fields. So I put both of them to my waitlist of best neighborhood and see if they have good results in following datasets. I also add Morningside,  Southside Slopes, and Brookline into the waitlist because all three of them have 6 baseball fields which are just 1 field less than the top two neighborhood. So all the five neighborhoods have the possibility to be the best neighborhood and it will depend on the following analysis.

## my second Conclusion

According to the second dataset analysis, the Squirrel Hill South is the top1 of having the most playround equipments. When I check the other four in my waitlist, only Southside Slopes neighborhood get into the top5 of the most playround equipments list. So I will delete the other three: Morningside, Brookline and Brighton Heights. Although tthese three have good performance in the first dataset anaylsis, they have a bad result in the second one. The best neighboehood should the the one that has a relatively good performance(top 5) on all three dataset. 

## my third Conclusion

In this dataset, Central Business District neighborhood has the best result for having the most art places and Squirrel Hill South is in the second place. But considering that Central Business District is not in the top5 in previous two dataset analysis, I would not add it to my waitlist. Also, Southside Slopes neighborhood is not in top5 for this time, so I deleted it from my waitlist. 

## graph of weights of each dataset analysis

DATASET ANALYSIS      &       WEIGHT FOR FINAL RESULT
     
Number of baseball Field ------------- 35%

Number of playround equipment -------- 35%

Number of art places ----------------- 30%

Personally, I give the first two part higher weights since I believe they are more important to a energetic neighborhood. Also, the Squirrel Hill South is the top1 neighborhood in the first two part and second place in the third one.

## Best Overall Neighborhood
According to the three dataset analysis, my waitlist only has Squirrel Hill South. So clearly Squirrel Hill South is the best overall neighborhood.
